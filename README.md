# 3 Dreams of Black
This project takes you on a journey through three dream worlds constructed through a combination of rich 2D drawings and animations interwoven with interactive 3D sequences. 
Throughout various points in these dream worlds, you can grab your pointer and guide the protagonist's point of view through the experience. This music experience also includes a 3D model creator that allows you to create your own relics and contribute to the shared collective dream. "3 Dreams of Black" is written and directed by Chris Milk, and developed with a few folks here at Google.
